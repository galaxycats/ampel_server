AmpelServer
-----------

This is a small Merb application to control a traffic light that is connected to your server via USB. The connection is realized through USBProg and the Simpleport firmware (http://www.embedded-projects.net/index.php?page_id=174).

A possible usage scenario would be to signal the actual build state of your Cruise Control via the traffic lights.
