# AmpelServer

This is a small Merb application to control a traffic light that is connected
to your server via USB. The connection is realized through USBProg and the
Simpleport firmware ([Simpleport Firmware](git remote add origin
git@github.com:railsbros/ampel_server.git "Simpleport Firmware")).

A possible usage scenario would be to signal the actual build state of your
Cruise Control via the traffic lights.
